           IT in modern business has become beyond paramount in this day and age. From use of the internet, to storing and transferring data between clients along with the constant immediate availability it provides for colleagues, managers and companies in general.
           Computers as they are now, are an absolute must in the business world. Performing functions, which would take us hours, in a matter of seconds. They provide the speed needed to close important deals, retrieve information and make those near impossible judgement calls which may make or break a business.
            Every generation of hardware and software, we are saving time and effort. Providing us more opportunities to jump into new ventures.
            Being able to do multiple functions and jobs at once, with minimal error is a testament to how far we’ve come in the way of technology, the sheer amount of data that can be processed in a split second is mind boggling, which is necessary for huge companies.
            Communication, live chat, video conferencing, email, between employers, employees, suppliers, and customers.
            Inventory management, being able to keep track of all the products available, stock levels, automatically starting an order request, tracking packages.
            Storing incredible amounts of data. From customer details, preferences, pay checks, employee benefits, patient information to being able to learn anything online.
            Tracking sales data, expenses, comparing the data to adjust sales techniques or employee training schemes, along with recording and storing video and audio of all customer interactions for future review and adjustment along with keeping up with current trends.

            Methods, Skills and Resources
        </h2>

        <p>
            There are a few tried and tested methodologies often utilised to complete digital projects, such as; Waterfall, Agile and Hybrid.<br>
            <strong>
                Waterfall
            </strong>
                :- This is the most common method used. It is a very rigid way of doing things, due to the specificity of the order in which the steps are to be completed. 
            On the flip side, it does provide an increased amount of control throughout each of the phases, it is a very formal method that benefits from being able to get all of the project requirements from the get go, meaning that the loss of key information is drastically reduced. The phases are as follows;
            <ul>
                <li>Requirements</li><br>
                <li>Design</li><br>
                <li>Implementation</li><br>
                <li>Testing</li><br>
                <li>Maintenance</li><br>
            </ul>
            <strong>
                Agile
            </strong> 
               :- One of the more flexible of the methodologies, which in turn creates a certain speed boost to it. It’s predominantly short bursts of information referred to as “sprints”, less control based is a good way to describe the project this avenue is best for.
            It provides the ability to consistently check for mistakes and add modifications due to the “sprints” and working on a small part at once.
            Therefore you don’t have to wait for the “testing” phase to be completely finished before you can update and fix a problem.<br>

            <strong>
                Hybrid
            </strong>
                :- As the name would suggest, is a mix of both Waterfall and Agile. Focusing on the Waterfall method in the beginning stages of planning and requirements, then switching to the Agile formula when it comes to the later stages with the design, develop, implement and evaluate parts.<br>
            
            Some of the skills necessary for completing digital projects successfully are<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaboration skills due to needing others to help and to work as a team;</li><br>
                <li>Problem solving skills</li><br>
                <li>Communication</li><br>
                <li>Attention to detail</li><br>
                <li>Organisational skills</li><br>
                <li>Goal and results driven</li><br>
                <li>And finally a thirst for knowledge is a must.</li>

            My plan and execution
        </h2>

        <p>
            The plan of building my site, was to break it down into so many tiny bite sizes to-do jobs, as you can see from my Trello board which I have linked 
            <a href="https://trello.com/b/75lzEYg5/coursework-website" target="_blank">
                here</a>, for example,
            I began by typing the answers to the prompts for the coursework in Notes, and I ended up copy and pasting them into my HTML skeleton I had built.
            Once I had the basics built, I began to flesh it out by adding a bit more class and colour to it, images, background, along with borders and a few other flourishes.

            Risks to the Market?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Some of the main risks that threaten digital projects are as follows
            <ul>
                <li>Cost Risk. Usually because of the constantly escalating project costs and poor cost estimation in the initial planning;</li><br>
                <li>Schedule risk. The change that things will take longer than originally expected, whether it be from lack of morale, unforseen circumstances or instances of change of scope.</li><br>
                <li>Market risk. Competitors are never far behind, and the risk that their project may come to fruition before yours is always there, the commodity market and credit risks are also ever present when it comes to new projects.</li><br>
                <li>External hazard. Natural disasters can affect the project. Things such as storms, flood or earthquakes could all but benefit the productivity of a project, along with the more human factors like vandalism, sabotage and civil unrest to name a few.</li><br>
            </ul>

        <h2>
            Selecting and Using Systems
        </h2>

        <p>
                Deciding which systems and software to use depends on a plethora of criteria. Some more essential than others however none should be overlooked.
                Security is of utmost importance. Being able to assure your customers and clients information is safe along with your employees data is an absolute must. It’s not just cyber security either, the physical risk from fires, unintentional corruption swell must be considered.
                Another main consideration to make is usability, can everyone use it, is it simple enough, can they be trained. You may have people from all walks of the business needing to use the system from CEO, to the mail sorter, to developers and marketing professionals, the system needs to be friendly enough for everyone otherwise having it is going to put extra strain on the few who can use it and will drastically reduce productivity.
                What are you business requirements? Does your system meet the needs your company has? Functionality is very important. What’s the point in having a system if it doesn’t do what you need it to do.
                Computer systems are all about connectivity and transferring data, running programmes on their own or with another machine, so integration needs to be a consideration. Do your systems gel well together and make a happy little situation or do they yell at each other and not do what they’re told.

            Achieving my Outcomes
        </h2>

        <p>
            Trello is absolutely fantastic, and there's absolutely no denying that.
            Trello is a wonderful tool when it comes to planning and managing your time. The ability to break down almost any task into bite sized pieces along with the team editing capabilities massively impacts the productivity and communication between colleagues.
            There are so many customisation and task tracking features on Trello, from adding an attachment, to labelling, to coloraturas coding for intended recipients, due dates, checklist, comments. I am unable to understand why 2019 is the first time I have ever heard about this system, it would have saved me countless sheets of paper if I’d known when I was younger.

            A bit about the GDPR
        </h2>

        <p>
            GPDR is the main data protection act in Europe, and although we’re leaving Europe, the UK has generally copied the GDPR into its own laws so there won’t be such a drastic change when it comes to Brexit.
            Included in both regulation variations, it includes the rights of the customers to access their own data whenever needed, the liability of the company collecting and processing the customers data, and more information relating to punishment of the misuse of said information.
            The misuse of personal data, which is defined as <q>Anything that allows a living person to be directly or indirectly identified</q> can come with hefty repercussions, not just the astronomical fines laid upon the company, but also for the customer, they may me impacted in the ways of financial loss and damage to reputation, to name a couple of negative effects.

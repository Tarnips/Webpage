                My Content and Layout
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you may have gathered, my intro page and its content are very casual. More of a personal greeting especially if you compare it to my coursework page.<br>
                The content on my coursework page is more of a professional nature, a lot of research went into it so I could make as much out of my time at this course as possible and add to my knowledge and experiences.<br>
                The layout created for my project is very simple and clean, the css file is not overly complicated due to wanting to keep it simple and readable. Aqua ontop to a black background is a striking contrast however not overpowering. Adding the borders around the paragraph elements distinguishes them as seperate, increasing readability and general aesthetic.<br>
                Using flexbox on the elements in the header gave me a new found respect for how rewarding it can be to finally solve something to the point that you're happy with it, especially as one of the elements was giving me a lot of trouble to begin with.<br>

            <h2>
                Copyright and Constraints
            </h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to websites and other public forums of information, Copyright is a large concern for many, as it could potentially land you in all sorts of legal trouble. Wether is be legal battles, hefty fines or even prison time.<br>
                <italic>So what exactly is copyright?</italic><br>
                Copyright is a form of intellectual property law, stating that if you own the rights to something, if you've created it or bought the rights for it, then you own it. It is protected under this law the moment it is created and is tangible, it refers to songs, paintings, software, writings and other such artistic works.<br>
                As it is, copyright is automatic at the moment of creation, however people often register their copyrights with the law as insurance that they did indeed create it themselves. For example if you were taken to court due to someone suing you over a copyright situation and you had registered through the legal means, then the case would fall apart because you would have a certification of validity.<br>
                Patents and trademarks aren't quite the same, copyright protects original works of authorship, patents are for discoveries and inventions and trademarks are usually symbols, phrases or logos used specifically by one party. So similar ideas, slightly different applications.
                If you'd like to know more about copyright then click <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">this link</a>.<br>
                Another concern while building a website is domain names, what you want the URL to read. You have first and second level domain names. The first level could be ".com", ".net" or ".org" to name a few of the more popular ones, then you have to decide the actual name of your site for the second level.<br>
                There is quite a few websites already out there so you need to make sure the one you have chosen is available and doesn't infringe on a copyrighted or trademarked name.<br>
                So you've found the name you want, it's available, now what? Well, you might want to obtain a trademark registration on the domain name, to protect you against possible lawsuits regarding the name.<br>
                For the final example of constraints against web building that I shall talk about is defamation. Basically defamation is making a statement to a third party, knowing full well that it is false, which could damage someone or some organizations reputation.<br>
                The law regarding defamation is very complex, as there are a lot of different situations and circumstances involved.

            <h2>
                Access and availability
            </h2>
            <p>
                Access to sites needs to be available to as many people as possible. Not everyone will necessarily be able to see or hear the content on the page, so it is our job as developers to find ways around such situations.<br>
                By adding text to speech programmes for those who struggle to read, we open up new avenues for the information to be received. In turn if we add subtitles to any audio we have on that page, we make that information available to those who are unable to hear perfectly.<br>
                It's these little things that make everyone feel included and appreciated. That is one of the aims of making a site, to create a friendly environment in which all the information is available to all people.
